Summary: This individual's T-score estimate of 51.30 (95% confidence interval: 48.28, 54.32) indicates self-reported communicative functioning
         approximately 0.10 standard deviations above the mean reported in a large reference sample of community-dwelling persons with aphasia
         of at least one month post-onset.

         T-scores are scaled such that the mean and standard deviation in the reference sample are 50 and 10, respectively. Given that the scores
         in the reference sample were approximately normally distributed, roughly 68% of scores drawn from the population are expected to fall
         between 40 and 60, and roughly 5% are expected to be lower than 30 or greater than 70.

         The confidence interval expresses the uncertainty in the score estimate, with wider intervals at a given confidence level indicating 
         greater uncertainty. If the test could be administered to this individual a large number of times under identical conditions,
         95 out of 100 of the of 95% confidence intervals would contain the true value of the communicative functioning score.
